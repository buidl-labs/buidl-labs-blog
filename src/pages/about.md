## Building ecosystems and infrastructure for web3.0

Buidl labs is a place for our experiments in the blockchain industry. We contribute with:

#### 🏗 Engineering throughput

We regularly contribute our spare + (sometimes) dedicated engineering bandwidth to projects we believe in.

#### 🚀 Ecosystem acceleration

We champion, advocate and evangelise + use our expertise in growth to drive adoption for projects we believe in.

#### 💰 Capital

Usually, money is the least of challenges that exist on the path to success. But when it isn't, we step in.

Building a business in a new technological paradigm is hard with the odds stacked against the daring pioneers. We help them improve those odds by contributing engineering and growth bandwidth to the projects we believe in. It's our way of saying, we believe in you.

We spend significant time and mindspace on helping other pioneers win. For all human progress rests on the initiative of the daring. And we spend a part of our time building products, for others. In Service and with Gratitude.

For sometimes, execution and unflinching belief are more important.
