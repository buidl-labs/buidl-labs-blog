## Building ecosystems and infrastructure for web3.0

Over the course of building several internet businesses and realizing how hard the process of new value creation is, we admire the ambition and audacity of the daring pioneers building in a new technological paradigm, even though we both know on some level that the odds of success are slim 🎢.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor. - Elon Musk

Hence we spend significant time and mindspace in helping the daring pioneers improve those odds by contributing with:

#### 🏗 Engineering throughput

We regularly contribute dedicated engineering bandwidth to projects we believe in.

#### 🚀 Ecosystem acceleration

We champion, advocate and evangelise + use our expertise in growth to drive adoption for projects we believe in.

#### 💰 Capital

Usually, money is the least of challenges that exist on the path to success. But when it isn't, we step in.

### Closing Note

All human progress rests on the initiative of the daring. And we spend a part of our time building products, for others. In service and with gratitude.

For sometimes, execution and unflinching belief are more important.
